                <h4 class="feature-heading">Voice controll</h4>
                <p class="feature-p">In order to optimize the input process, it is possible to set voice control through a voice control assistant as the default input method when opening the application for the first time. With voice control activated, the travel suggestions which is optimized for blind and visually impaired, could be announced and explained by the voice control assistant.</p>
                <p class="feature-p">By integrating a voice assistant in the application you will have access to voice recognition as guidance on the journey. The integrated voice assistant enables the application to be used as additional guidance for partially sighted in combination with map information with high contrasts. The user can regulate the level of detail and the type of information received. This enables the application to be used in areas that the user is familiar with and places that the user is visiting for the first time.</p>
                <p class="feature-p">The option of being able to regulate what type of information and the frequency of announcements to the user makes BlindMate suitable for a large audience with varying degree of visual impairment.</p>

                <h4 class="feature-heading">Guidance to stops</h4>
                <p class="feature-p">After BlindMate has suggested a route to your destination, it will help you navigate from your current position or chosen start position, to the bus/train/tram stop. In order to supply optimized guidance and directions to the correct stop, BlindMate offers guidance both through the voice control assistant and through a navigation interface with high contrast maps.</p>
                <p class="feature-p">The solution is integrated with Ruter-labs’ API, which means the solution utilizes an already well developed solution for real-time information. Google Maps is used for map information, this enables detailed map information and constantly updated traffic information that will be considered by BlindMate’s travel planner.</p>

                <h4 class="feature-heading">Finding the correct departure</h4>
                <p class="feature-p">The integrated voice control assistant offers real-time guidance at the stop to locate the correct departure. The voice control assistant also keeps the user continually updated with live information concerning delays and deviations combined with departure-specific information such as when the correct departure is ready for boarding.</p>
                <p class="feature-p">One of the most obvious challenges of using public transportation for visually impaired and totally blind is to find the correct departure at the stop. At stops where there is much noise it is challenging to locate the correct departure, but also to separate the correct departure among several departures with approximately the same departure time. BlindMate is therefore utilizing real-time information combined with the voice assistant to offer adaptable information about available departures, time to departure and possible deviations in real-time.</p>

                <h4 class="feature-heading">Assistance during the journey</h4>
                <p class="feature-p">The voice control assistant is available during the entire journey. The voice control assistant provides on-demand information such as estimated travel time and time remaining to destination by either clicking the icon or requesting update by voice. In the case that you would need to transfer during your journey, you will receive the necessary information about the transfer from the voice control assistant. All information provided will also be shown on the screen for the partially sighted.</p>
                <p class="feature-p">By integrating a voice assistant in combination with a real-time information from Ruter and Google Maps in the application you will have access to up to date voice recognized guidance for the entire trip. By regulating the type of information and frequency of it, the user can form the voice assistant to their own preference. The assistance on the way will, of desired, pay attention to how often you travel the same route, and this way the user will be able to choose what information that is going to be presented by the voice assistant on more familiar routes.</p>
                <p class="feature-p">On the basis of BlindMate’s goal to offer a complete solution, the application will guide the user in case of transitions. If it is necessary to walk to the next stop will BlindMate use your current position to continue to guide the user while walking between stops.</p>

                <h4 class="feature-heading">The road ahead</h4>
                <p class="feature-p">BlindMate aspires to be a learning organization in order to contribute to social innovation. By integrating some of the best already existing solutions in the market and optimizing them for blind and partially sighted you minimize the time to market. By integrating the already developed solutions you secure both shot development time and maximize usage of available software.</p>
                <p class="feature-p">The voice assistant will also take advantage of the real-time information from other cities in a continuous development. The updates will be available in the application continuously. On a later stage in the development the application aims to be able to integrate information to and from destinations such as airports with direct access to gate-information in the application as well as integration of interregional traveling options. Further development and improvements are important. Further development and adaptation to situations in the real world is most efficient by receiving feedback from the users.</p>
                <p class="feature-p">To be able to improve the solution optimally do we in BlindMate appreciate the feedback from our users. BlindMate integrate therefor an option to give feedback within the application. We in BlindMate believe this creates a win-win-situation as the user will get a better solution and we in BlindMate can use this feedback to continually develop the solution, focusing on continous improvement.</p>
