            <h3>About BlindMate</h3>
            <p>BlindMate is an app, designed for users who are blind or have low vision that wish to use public transport. BlindMate assists the user to the correct stop, during the journey and from the stop to the final destination. The voice assistant uses real-time data from the public transport system. This keeps the user up-to-date about deviations before and during the journey.</p>

                    <h4>Goals</h4>
                    <p>BlindMate's goal is to make transport more available. Our long-term goal comes from our vision about equal opportunities. Our solution use technology that is well developed and many have access to from their smartphones.</p>
                    <p>A part of the goal is to make traveling with public transport as easy as possible. We aim to offer a solution that assists the user from start to stop. To assist users who are blind and who have low vision, BlindMate has integrated several functions. BlindMate has functions such as maps in high contrast and Ruter's real-time data which is used with the voice assistant.</p>
                    <h4>Target market</h4>
                    <p>Statistics Norway conducted surveys on the share of smartphone ownership. These showed that in the age range of 9-79 years the share went from 57% in 2012 to 85% in 2015. (<a target="_blank" href="http://medienorge.uib.no/statistikk/medium/ikt/388">medienorge.uib.no</a>). With the high share of smartphone usage there are many potential users who may benefit from the solution. By using technology in smartphones it is possible to make a solution quickly available to many users.</p>

            <h3>About the problem</h3>
            <p>The public transport system in Norway is not well adapted for blind or low vision users, and this might be a challenge. The challenge is the sum of smaller problems that occur during the journey. These systems might make this group use public transport less often. This is unwanted because the public transport in Oslo is good.</p>

                    <h4>More about the problem</h4>
                    <p>The official organization for blindness and eye diseases (Norges Blindeforbund) reports about 180 000 totally blind and visually impaired in Norway (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.blindeforbundet.no/oyehelse-og-synshemninger/fakta-og-statistikk-om-synshemninger">blindeforbundet.no</a>). It is important to know of real-world challenges of using public transport in Oslo to grasp the challenges. To better understand the challenges, we had an informal survey with some of the members of Norges Blindeforbund. The survey shows that the most common are to get on and transfer between the correct bus/tram/train.</p>
                    <h4>Important challenges</h4>
                    <p>Some of the challenges of traveling with public transport, are:</p>
                    <ul class="list">
                        <li>Finding the stop</li>
                        <li>Finding the correct departure</li>
                        <li>Transfers during the journey</li>
                        <li>Little information during the journey</li>
                        <li>Lack of information about remaining travel time</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The survey showed that 94.9% use public transport a couple of times per month or per week. 71.8% would also like to travel more with public transport if the solution was launched. This shows that there is a big potential user group for BlindMate.</p>
