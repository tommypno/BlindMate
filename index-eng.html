            <h3>About BlindMate</h3>
            <p>BlindMate is an integrated aid, specially designed for visually impaired and totally blind who wish to travel by public transportation. BlindMate aim to supply a fully integrated solution that is capable of assisting the user from their current
                location to the correct stop, during the journey and from the correct stop to the final destination. With the help of the voice assistant that utilizes real time information from the local public transportation system, the user is continually
                kept up-to-date about delays and deviations before and during the journey.</p>

                    <h3>Our vision</h3>
                    <p>Our goal through providing a solution in the form of a tool for blind and visually impaired is to make already available transportation solutions more available to a larger group of people. Our long-term goal is conceptualized through
                        a vision about equal opportunities for everyone. The solution utilizes technology which is widespread and well developed. By utilizing technology implemented in smartphones, already available to a large share of the population
                        it is possible to make a solution quickly available to many users. A desirable part of the goal is to make the usage of public transportation as seamless as possible. BlindMate therefore strives to develop a solution that assists
                        the user from start to stop.</p>
                    <p>With rapid technological development, the share of the population using available technology increases. Statistics provided by Statistics Norway shows that the share of smartphone ownership in the age range of 9-79 years has increased
                        rapidly over the last years. In 2012 the share was 57%, while it had increased to 85% in 2015. (<a target="_blank" href="http://medienorge.uib.no/statistikk/medium/ikt/388">http://medienorge.uib.no/statistikk/medium/ikt/388</a>).
                        With the high share of smartphone usage there exists a large potential for benefit with low cost for users. This makes the execution of a solution cost effective and therefore more accessible to a greater number of users. To facilitate
                        for blind and partially sighted has BlindMate implemented several extra functions and implemented usage of both map information and Ruter's real-time information in BlindMate's functions.</p>

            <h3>About the problem</h3>
            <p>Blind and visually impaired who wish to travel by public transportation may experience it as a challenge. The challenge is often a sum of several sub-problems that occur during the journey.</p>

                    <h3>More about the problem</h3>
                    <p>One of the problems in public transportation in Norway, is that it is not fully accessible for totally blind or visually impaired. To travel with public transportation can be a struggle, which lead them to use the system less. This
                        is unfortunate because the public transportation system in Oslo is well-developed. Blind and visually impaired might use this system less frequently than desired because of the challenge of using it, which leads to inequality.
                        The most obvious problems when traveling with public transportation, are for example:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Finding the stop</li>
                        <li>Locating the correct departure</li>
                        <li>Transfers during the journey</li>
                        <li>Information during the journey</li>
                        <li>Lack of information regarding remaining travel time and clear information about remaining time to the destination</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>According to Norges blindeforbund (official organization for blindness and eye diseases in Norway) there are approximately 180 000 totally blind and visually impaired in Norway (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.blindeforbundet.no/oyehelse-og-synshemninger/fakta-og-statistikk-om-synshemninger">https://www.blindeforbundet.no/oyehelse-og-synshemninger/fakta-og-statistikk-om-synshemninger</a>).
                        In order to gain a more detailed understanding of the challenge and the real-world experience there was conducted an informal survey with the help of Norges blindeforbund.</p>
                    <p>The most common problems related to public transportation are to get on the correct bus/tram/train and transfer between them. The survey shows that 71.8% of the participants would like to travel more with public transportation if the
                        solution was launched. 94.9% of the participants use public transportation a couple of times per month or per week. This shows that there are a big potential user group for BlindMate.</p>
